# Comprehensive-analysis-and-predictive-modelling-of-Air-pollution
This project aims to analyze and predict air pollution levels using machine learning techniques. We perform a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on air quality data, identifying trends, seasonal variations, and the impact of various pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, NO₂, SO₂)
